# Overview
This is a simple Javascript weather web app. It consumes a weather API, and I have plans to implement a 
geolocation API. 
It's a place I plan to refine more of my Javascript skills. 


# Development Environment
* VS Code
* JavaScript, HTML
* OpenWeather API

# Useful Websites
* [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/price)
* [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)

# Future Plans
* I would like to use this as an opportunity to practice some CSS skills.
* There is another API I would like to implement to get the user's location instead of them entering the latitude and longitude. 
* More input validation and other user friendly touches.
